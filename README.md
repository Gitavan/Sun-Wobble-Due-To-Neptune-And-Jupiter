# Sun-Wobble-Due-To-Neptune-And-Jupiter
A project I made during my undergraduate years on the gravitational interaction that Neptune and Jupiter have on the Sun showcased a wobbling behaviour.

## The code is separated into 3 tasks:
### Task 1
Initialised the mass, XY coordinates and velocity of the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn.
Calculate the XY coordinates of Jupiter and Saturn using the gravitational attraction force
Plotted the XY coordinates of Jupiter and Saturn if the Sun was at a fixed point and shown as a GIF.
### Task 2
Similar to Task 1, but now the XY coordinates of the sun were calculated by the attraction forces exerted by Jupiter and Saturn
The result is showcased as a plot and GIF.
### Task 3
Plotted only the Sun Coordinates in comparison to its centre of mass
Generated a GIF showcasing the plot path.
